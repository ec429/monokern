monokern: a project to create a kerned monospace font for terminals and code.

"Wait, did you say /kerned monospace/?"  Yes, I did - and that's not as ridiculous as it sounds.  The alignment of columnar and tabular text that monospace provides relies not on the spacing itself being constant, but of the sum of the spacing over longer runs being constant.  Thus, so long as a narrow pair-kerning is balanced out by a wide pair-kerning nearby, tables will remain aligned.
The basic idea behind monokern is /deviation kerning/: any individual character is permitted to deviate a fixed amount from its grid position.  In the initial experiments, this will be 1px, because we're working with smallish fonts around 10 or 12pt.  Then, since interword spacing can be crushed or expanded a couple of px without the sky falling (hence why justified text is readable), the software need only optimise deviation across each word.

To display an 80x24 text monokerned: ./kernify <text
To build your own kerning tables: ./mk_kern > mk_runs/foo; cat mk_runs/* | ./mk_scores > scores
To run a terminal that monokerns text: ./termk [shell]

termk emulates a vt52, which is somewhat limited in its capabilities.
It supports cursor movement, and consequently termcap/curses will work (so long as your termcap has an entry for vt52, which it should), but it doesn't support colour or other attributes.
Also, termk does not currently have Unicode support.
