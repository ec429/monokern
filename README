monokern: a project to create a kerned monospace font for terminals and code.

"Wait, did you say /kerned monospace/?"  Yes, I did - and that's not as ridiculous as it sounds.  The alignment of columnar and tabular text that monospace provides relies not on the spacing itself being constant, but of the sum of the spacing over longer runs being constant.  Thus, so long as a narrow pair-kerning is balanced out by a wide pair-kerning nearby, tables will remain aligned.
The basic idea behind monokern is /deviation kerning/: any individual character is permitted to deviate a fixed amount from its grid position.  In the initial experiments, this is 1px, because we're working with a small font just 6px wide.
kern.o performs the basic monokerning operation, using a dynamic-programming algorithm with linear-time performance.

To run a terminal that monokerns text: termk [shell] [shellargs]

termk emulates a vt52, which is somewhat limited in its capabilities.
It supports cursor movement, and consequently termcap/curses will work (so long as your termcap has an entry for vt52, which it should), but it doesn't support colour or other attributes.
Also, termk does not currently have Unicode support.
Lastly note that termk gets the font (and kerning tables) from an archive 'as.termkf' which it expects to find in /usr/local/share/fonts; consequently, you need to [sudo] make install, first, or it won't run.
