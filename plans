monokern: plans & ideas

* Redesign the 'scores' format (and mangle the current scores file into the new format) to handle 2px deviations
* Write a program to automatically de-comment pbm files (thereby saving space in the .termk font)
* Find a better way of detecting when wide-glyphs can be used, and positioning them accordingly
* Fix the SIGTSTP hang when exec fails (can we fix it by handling SIGCHLD?)
