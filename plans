monokern: plans & ideas

* Redesign the 'scores' format (and mangle the current scores file into the new format) to handle 2px deviations
* Create (from scratch) a larger font, possibly 8x18, maybe with a humanist style
* Write a program to automatically de-comment pbm files (thereby saving space in the .termk font)
